# puppy-tracker

This is a simple command line utility to track the price of $PUPPY from the https://puppy-price.vercel.app/api/get-price API (developed by the folks at Skip)

The utility will alert via sound if there is a positive or negative price movement => 2.5% over a period of 2 minutes (equal to 2 price checks).
